<p><span class="smcap">A recent</span> writer remarks that ‘the practice of
letters is miserably harassing to the mind. To
find the right word is so doubtful a success, and
lies so near to failure, that there is no satisfaction
in a year of it.’ A cynical warning, indeed; but
there is, we think, no danger of a scarcity of
literary effort in the immediate future, whatever
the appreciable results of it may be. There will
always be a host of aspirants for literary honours,
and the reason of this may perhaps lie, to a
certain extent, in that very uncertainty which
attends the pursuit of letters as an avocation;
the brilliant rewards which have been earned and
the underlying risk of failure, present together
the very conditions of enterprise most powerfully
attractive to many minds. For it must be
remembered that there is no fixedness in the
canon either of public opinion or of criticism in
literature; that which fails to win attention
to-day, may attract to-morrow; and success, especially
that form of it which results from passing
popularity, is in many cases very much dependent
on the proverbial fickleness of the reading public.
It would be difficult, we think, on other grounds
than that of this attractiveness of the chances
and prizes of the literary occupation, to account
for the active competition which is so observable
in the profession. That the pure literary faculty,
as a stimulus, does not form a distinguishing
characteristic of all aspirants, is plain enough.
No doubt, a great impetus has been given to
literary endeavour by the periodical press, which,
by popularising ephemeral literature among the
masses, and by its own requirements of supply,
has thus increased its production. And the
same is true of the newspaper press also, with
its opportunities for the contribution of correspondence,
which, though frequently a humble
enough opening for talent, has often sufficed to
originate and foster the habit of more ambitious
composition.</p>

<p>The canon of literary criticism is, we have said,
not an unvarying one. But undoubtedly there
is, for all perfect, and still more for all enduring
work in the world of letters a certain measure
and standard of excellence in the mode of
expression, which even the most brilliant genius
cannot afford wholly to disregard, but which is
as incapable of exact definition as it is difficult
of attainment. It is much more, certainly, than
‘the finding of the right word,’ even granting
that the right idea be behind it. A literary
composition may be characterised by the most
perfect accuracy of expression, may be faultless
in every detail, and yet be after all a very
mediocre piece of work at the best, though it
may be difficult exactly to indicate in what respect
it is defective. We can only in a case of this
kind point to acknowledged merit as possessing
what the attempt in question lacks.</p>

<p>It has also to be noted that excellence in
literary workmanship is properly independent
both of the nature of its subject and the scale
on which it is executed. An instance of this
may be found in Thackeray’s <i>Roundabout Papers</i>.
In these apparently careless sketches, a designedly
trivial subject is chosen; the treatment of it is
everything, and the artistic finish is of the
highest; the subject is dwarfed in the handling,
and yet the very handling interests the reader
abnormally in the subject. Perhaps, however,
this subordination of the subject to the treatment&mdash;as
in the inimitable narrative of the schoolboy
purchasing, from his companion, the pencil-case
with the movable calendar atop&mdash;is as a whole
inferior to that method by which the incidents
of the subject are brought out in relief, as it
were, by the simplicity of the description, so
much so, that the art of that simplicity is concealed.
Nathaniel Hawthorne in his <i>House of
the Seven Gables</i> and several of the <i>Twice-told
Tales</i> has some exquisitely pellucid specimens of
this complete literary facility. In such masterpieces
we see the results only, without any indication
of the labour involved in its execution. The
statue is there in all its finished loveliness, but
the chips of the marble have been swept away.
‘How clear and flowing your melody is,’ was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">{66}</span>
once remarked to an eminent musical composer;
‘how easily you must write!’ ‘Ah!’ replied
he, ‘you little know with what hard work that
ease you speak of has been purchased.’ When
the late Charles Mathews was playing in Melbourne,
fifteen years ago, he received what he
considered the highest compliment of his professional
career. A little girl in the audience was
asked by her friends at the conclusion of the
performance how she was pleased, to which she
replied: ‘I didn’t care for Mr Mathews’ acting
a bit; he just walked up and down the stage
as papa walks up and down the dining-room at
home.’ It is the fact of this appearance of
perfect spontaneity in the highest art, being
really the outcome of the most assiduous care,
that renders it so truly inimitable, and the counterfeit
so easy of detection. The ‘round O of
Giotto’ was only a perfect circle, but it needed
the master-hand to execute it with a simple
sweep of the crayon. Ruskin tells us in one
of his treatises on Landscape Painting, that in
some of the greatest works of genius, an effect
which is almost magical at the proper focal
distance, is conveyed by what appears, to the
uninstructed eye and viewed close at hand, to
be a mere dash of loaded colour, but which in
reality could not be added to or diminished by
the smallest particle without detracting from the
effect.</p>

<p>If it be true that literary excellence is only
to be attained by the patient bestowal of ‘infinite
pains,’ that there is no easy method of reaching
it, it is no less the fact that, as a general rule,
the time is wasted&mdash;perhaps worse than wasted&mdash;which
is devoted by the young writer to a
laborious imitation of the style of any distinguished
author. Such an imitation is generally
an unsuccessful one, and results in a reproduction
of the faults and defects of the original
without its graces. The advice Dr Johnson gave
to those ‘desirous of attaining the English style,’
to ‘give their days and nights to the volumes of
Addison,’ must be taken with reserve. Such a
style, though eminently beautiful in itself, would
practically nowadays be out of date, even if faithfully
reproduced, while at the same time it is
most likely that the student would overlook that
deficiency of force with which the manner of
Addison is fairly chargeable. The best model
for style is not that of any particular or favourite
writer, but rather the excellency of the best
writers generally&mdash;the highest qualities of the
highest types.</p>

<p>We have hitherto spoken of that perfect mastery
of our language in writing which has been the
possession of those famous in the history of
English letters, and it may be inquired if such
a high standard should in all cases be necessarily
aimed at, seeing that for many purposes of everyday
life a lesser degree of cultivation might be
found as practically useful. To this it is sufficient
to reply that much positive good must result from
an endeavour to follow the best examples in the
practice of any art, and further, that such an
endeavour will be found the surest way by which
to avoid all faulty and careless work, which can
under no possible conditions be praiseworthy or
even tolerable. No young writer can afford to
write carelessly, till such time, at all events, as he
has become fully versed in his art, when he will
probably find that to write with the effect of
carelessness is beyond his power. At the same
time, young writers should be careful not to adopt
for imitation a style of too great elevation, for by
so doing they may find that they have contracted
that worst of all literary diseases&mdash;bombast.</p>

<p>In estimating the amount of labour bestowed
on the production of literary work, care must be
taken to include the original mental processes
involved in the conception of the ideas, as well
as the subsequent elaboration of them in detail;
the higher sort of composition includes both;
and it is evident that when the question comes
to be one of the labour of origination, we find
ourselves in a region where estimate is all but
impossible. ‘The workshop of the imagination’
will reveal no record of its toil. Edgar Allan
Poe, indeed, in his <i>Philosophy of Composition</i> introduces
us to what he would have us believe to be
the very beginnings of invention, endeavouring
to portray the very earliest growth of his marvellous
constructive faculty exemplified in his poem
of <i>The Raven</i>. But his explanation reads more
like an intellectual pastime than a reality, even
if it were beyond question that the central idea of
the poem was original, and not borrowed from
an eastern source. In the case of Auguste Comte,
however, we have an instance of the amount of
intellectual travail which may often precede the
birth of a great work, the mental preparation
before the committal of the thoughts to paper.
To quote M. Littré’s account of Comte’s method:
‘Here is the way in which he composed each of
the six volumes of the Positive philosophy. He
thought the subject over without writing a word;
from the whole he passed to the secondary groups,
from the secondary groups to the details. Then,
when this elaboration, first total, then partial,
was completed, he said that his volume was
done.’</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three weeks’ difference in practical time
between England and the West Indies, due to
the mail, made the day that Edward and Marian
spent at Southampton exactly coincide with the
one when Mr Dupuy and his nephew Tom went
up to view old Mr Hawthorn’s cattle at Agualta
Estate, Trinidad. On that very same evening,
while Nora and Harry were walking together
among the fields behind the battery, Mr Tom
Dupuy was strolling leisurely by himself in the
cool dusk, four thousand miles away, on one of
the innumerable shady bridle-paths that thread
the endless tangled hills above Pimento Valley.</p>

<p>Mr Tom was smoking a very big Manila cheroot,
and was accompanied upon his rounds by a huge
and ferocious-looking Cuban bloodhound, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">{67}</span>
hungry corners of whose great greedy slobbering
mouth hung down hideously on either side in
loose folds of skin of the most bloodthirsty and
sinister aspect. As he went along, Tom Dupuy
kept patting affectionately from time to time
his four-footed favourite, to whom, nevertheless,
every now and again he applied, as it seemed
out of pure wantonness, the knotted lash of the
cruel dog-whip which he carried jauntily in his
right hand. The dog, however, formidable as he
was, so far from resenting this unkindly treatment,
appeared to find in it something exceedingly
congenial to his own proper barbarous nature;
for after each such savage cut upon his bare
flanks from the knotted hide, he only cowered
for a second, and then fawned the more closely
and slavishly than ever upon his smiling master,
looking up into his face with a strange approving
glance from his dull eyes, that seemed to
say: ‘Exactly the sort of thing I should do
myself, if you were the dog, and I were the
whip-holder.’</p>

<p>At a bend of the path, where the road turned
suddenly aside to cross the dry bed of a winter
torrent, Tom Dupuy came upon a clump of
tall cabbage palms, hard by a low mud-built
negro hut, overshadowed in front by two or
three huge flowering bushes of crimson hibiscus.
A tall, spare, gray-headed negro, in a coarse
sack by way of a shirt, with his bare and
sinewy arms thrust loosely through the long
slits which alone did duty in the place of
sleeve-holes, was leaning as he passed upon a
wooden post. The bloodhound, breaking away
suddenly from his master, at sight and smell
of the black skin, its natural prey, rushed up
fiercely towards the old labourer, and leapt
upon him with a savage snarl of his big teeth,
and with ominous glittering eyes. But the negro,
stronger and more muscular than he looked,
instead of flinching, caught the huge brute in his
long lean arms, and flung him from him by main
force with an angry oath, dashing his great form
heavily against the rough pathway. Quick as
lightning, the dog, leaping up again at once with
diabolical energy in its big flabby mouth, was
just about to spring once more upon his scowling
opponent, when Tom Dupuy, catching him
angrily by his leather collar, threw him down
and held him back, growling fiercely, and showing
his huge tearing teeth in a ferocious grin, after
the wonted manner of his deadly kind. ‘Quiet,
Slot, quiet!’ the master said, patting his hollow
forehead with affectionate admiration. ‘Quiet,
sir; down this minute! Down, I tell you!&mdash;He’s
death on niggers, Delgado&mdash;death on niggers.
You should stand out of the way, you know,
when you see him coming. Of course, these
dogs never can abide the scent of you black
fellows. The <i>bookay d’Afreek</i> always drives a
bloodhound frantic.’</p>

<p>The old negro drew himself up haughtily
and sternly, and stared back in the insolent
face of the slouching young white man with a
proud air of native dignity. ‘Buckra gentleman
hab no right, den, to go about wid dem dog,’
he answered angrily, fixing his piercing fiery
eye on the bloodhound’s face. ‘Dem dog always
spring at a black man wherebber dey find him.
If you want to keep dem, you should keep
dem tied up at de house, so as to do for watchdog
against tievin’ naygur. But you doan’t got
no right to bring dem about de ro-ads, loose
dat way, jumpin’ up at people’s troats, when
dem standin’ peaceable beside dem own hut
here.’</p>

<p>Tom Dupuy laughed carelessly. ‘It’s their
nature, you see, Delgado,’ he answered with a
pleasant smile, still holding the dog and caressing
it lovingly. ‘They and their fathers were
trained long ago in slavery days to hunt runaway
niggers up in the mountains and track
them to their hiding-places, and drag them
back, alive or dead, to their lawful masters;
and of course that makes them run naturally
after the smell of a nigger, as a terrier runs
after the smell of a rat. When the rat sees
the terrier coming, he scuttles off as hard as
his legs can carry him into his hole; and when
you see Slot’s nose turning round the corner,
you ought to scuttle off into your hut as quick
as lightning, if you want to keep your black
skin whole upon your body. Slot never can
abide the smell of a nigger.&mdash;Can you, Slot, eh,
old fellow?’</p>

<p>The negro looked at him with unconcealed
aversion. ‘I is not rat, Mistah Dupuy,’ he said
haughtily. ‘I is gentleman myself, same as you
is, sah, when I come here over from Africa.’</p>

<p>Tom Dupuy sneered openly in his very face.
‘That’s the way with all you Africans,’ he
answered with a laugh, as he flipped the ash
idly from his big cheroot. ‘I never knew an
imported nigger yet, since I was born, that
wasn’t a king in his own country. Seems to
me, they must all be kings over yonder in
Congo, with never a solitary subject to divide
between them.&mdash;But I say, my friend, what’s
going on over this way to-night, that so many
niggers are going up all the time to the Methody
chapel? Are you going to preach ’em a missionary
sermon?’</p>

<p>Delgado glanced at him a trifle suspiciously.
‘Dar is a prayer-meetin’, sah,’ he said with a
cold look in his angry eye, ‘up at Gilead. De
bredderin gwine to meet dis ebenin’.’</p>

<p>‘Ho, ho; so that’s it! A prayer-meeting, is
it? Well, if I go up there, will you let me
attend it?’</p>

<p>Delgado’s thick lip curled contemptuously, as
he answered with a frown: ‘When cockroach
gib dance, him no ax fowl!’</p>

<p>‘Ah, I see. The fowl would eat the cockroaches,
would he? Well, then, Louis Delgado,
I give you fair warning; if you don’t want a
white man to go and look on at your nigger
meetings, depend upon it, it’s because you’re
brewing some mischief or other up there
against the constituted authorities. I shall tell
my uncle to set his police to look well after
you. You were always a bad-blooded, discontented,
disaffected fellow, and I believe now
you’re up to some of your African devilry
or other. No obeah,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> mind you, Delgado&mdash;no
obeah! Prayer-meetings, my good friend, as much
as you like; but whatever you do, no obeah.’</p>

<p>‘You tink I do obeah because I doan’t will
let you go to prayer-meetin’! Dat just like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">{68}</span>
white-man argument. Him tink de naygur can
nebber be in de right. Old-time folk has little
proverb: “Mountain sheep always guilty when
jungle tiger sit to judge him.”’</p>

<p>Tom Dupuy laughed and nodded. ‘Well,
good-night.&mdash;Down, Slot, down, good fellow;
down, down, down, I tell you!&mdash;Good-night,
Louis Delgado, and mind, whatever you do, no
obeah!’</p>

<p>The negro watched him slowly round the
corner, with a suspicious eye kept well fixed upon
the reluctant stealthy retreat of the Cuban bloodhound;
and as soon as Dupuy had got safely
beyond earshot, he sat down in the soft dust
that formed the bare platform outside his hut,
and mumbled to himself, as negroes will do,
a loud dramatic soliloquy, in every deep and
varying tone of passion and hatred. ‘Ha, ha,
Mistah Tom Dupuy,’ he began quietly, ‘so you
go about always wid de Cuban bloodhound, an’
you laugh to see him spring at de troat ob de
black man! You tink dat frighten him from
come steal your cane an’ your mangoes! You
tink de black man afraid ob de dog, yarra!
yarra! Ha, dat frighten Trinidad naygur, perhaps,
but it doan’t frighten salt-water naygur
from Africa! I hab charms, I hab potion, I
hab draught to quiet him! I doan’t afraid ob
fifty bloodhound. But it doan’t good for buckra
gentleman to walk about wid dog dat spring at
de black man. Black man laugh to-day, perhaps,
but press him heart tight widin him. De time
come when black man will find him heart break
out, an’ de hate in it flow over an’ make blood
run, like dry ribber in de rainy season. Den him
sweep away buckra, an’ bloodhound, an’ all before
him; an’ seize de country, colour for colour.
De land is black, an’ de land for de black man.
When de black man burst him heart like ribber
burst him bank in de rainy season, white man’s
house snap off before him like bamboo hut when
de flood catch it!’ As he spoke, he pushed his
hands out expansively before him, and gurgled
in his throat with fierce inarticulate African
gutturals, that seemed to recall in some strange
fashion the hollow eddying roar and gurgle of
the mountain torrents in the rainy season.</p>

<p>‘Chicken doan’t nebber lub jackal, yarra,’ he
went on after a short pause of expectant triumph;
‘an’ naygur doan’t nebber lub buckra, dat
certain. But ob all de buckra in de island ob
Trinidad, dem Dupuy is de very worst an’ de
very contemptfullest. Some day, black man will
rise, an’ get rid ob dem all for good an’ ebber.
If I like, I can kill dem all to-day; but I gwine
to wait. De great an’ terrible day ob de Lard
is not come yet. Missy Dupuy ober in England,
where de buckra come from. England is de
white man’s Africa; de missy dar to learn him
catechism. I wait till Missy Dupuy come back
before I kill de whole family. When de great
an’ terrible day ob de Lard arrive, I doan’t leave
a single Dupuy a libbin soul in de island ob
Trinidad. I slay dem all, an’ de missy wid dem,
yarra, yarra!’</p>

<p>The last two almost inarticulate words were
uttered with a yell of triumph. Hearing footsteps
now approaching, he broke out into
a loud soliloquy of exultation in his own
native African language. It was a deep,
savage-sounding West Coast dialect, full of harsh
and barbaric clicks or gutturals; for Louis
Delgado, as Tom Dupuy had rightly said,
was ‘an imported African’&mdash;a Coromantyn, sold
as a slave some thirty years before to a
Cuban slave-trader trying to break the blockade
on the coast, and captured with all her
living cargo by an English cruiser off Sombrero
Island. The liberated slaves had been landed,
according to custom, at the first British port
where the cutter touched; and thus Louis
Delgado&mdash;as he learned to call himself&mdash;a wild
African born, from the Coromantyn seaboard,
partially Anglicised and outwardly Christianised,
was now a common West Indian plantation hand
on the two estates of Orange Grove and Pimento
Valley. There are dozens of such semi-civilised
imported negroes still to be found under similar
circumstances in every one of the West India
islands.</p>

<p>As the steps gradually approached nearer, it
became plain, from the soft footfall in the dust
of the bridle-path, that it was a shoeless black
person who was coming towards him. In a
minute more, the new-comer had turned the
corner, and displayed herself as a young and
comely negress&mdash;pretty with the round, good-humoured
African prettiness of smooth black
skin, plump cheeks, clear eyes, and regular, even
pearl-white teeth. The girl was dressed in a
loose Manchester cotton print, brightly coloured,
and not unbecoming, with a tidy red bandana
bound turban-wise around her shapely head, but
barefooted, barelimbed, and bare of neck and
shoulder. Her figure was good, as the figure
of most negresses usually is; and she held herself
erect and upright with the peculiar lithe gracefulness
said to be induced by the universal
practice of carrying pails of water and other
burdens on the top of the head from the very
earliest days of negro childhood. As she approached
Delgado, she first smiled and showed
all her pretty teeth, as she uttered the customary
polite salutation of ‘Marnin’! sah, marnin’!’ and
then dropped a profound courtesy with an unmistakable
air of awe and reverence.</p>

<p>Louis Delgado affected not to observe the girl
for a moment, and went on jabbering loudly
and fiercely to himself in his swift and fluent
African jargon. But it was evident that his
hearer was deeply impressed at once by this
rapt and prophetic inattention of the strange
negro, who spoke with tongues to vacant space
in such an awful and intensely realistic fashion.
She paused for a while and looked at him
intently; then, when he stopped for a second
to take breath in the midst of one of his passionate
incoherent outbursts, she came a step
nearer to him and courtesied again, at the same
time that she muttered in a rather injured querulous
treble: ‘Mistah Delgado, you no hear me,
sah? You no listen to me? I tellin’ you
marnin’.’</p>

<p>The old man broke off suddenly, as if recalled
to himself and common earth by some disenchanting
touch, and answered dreamily: ‘Marnin’,
Missy Rosina. Marnin’, le-ady. You gwine up
to Gilead now to de prayer-meetin’?’</p>

<p>Rosina, glancing down at the Bible and hymn-book
in her plump black hand, answered demurely:
‘Yes, sah, I gwine dar.’</p>

<p>Delgado shook himself vigorously, as if in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">{69}</span>
endeavour to recover from some unearthly trance,
and went on in his more natural manner: ‘I
gwine up too, to pray wid de bredderin. You
want me for someting? You callin’ to me for
help you?’</p>

<p>Rosina dropped her voice a little as she replied
in her shrill tone: ‘You is African, Mistah
Delgado. Naygur from Africa know plenty spell
for bring back le-ady’s lubber.’</p>

<p>Delgado nodded. ‘Dat is true,’ he answered.
‘Creole<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> naygur doan’t can make spell same as
African. Coromantyn naygur hab plenty oracle.
De oracles ob Aaron descend in right line to de
chiefs ob de Coromantyn.’</p>

<p>‘Dem say you is great chief in your own
country.’</p>

<p>The old man drew himself up with a haughty
air. ‘Me fader,’ he answered with evident pride,
‘hab twelve wives, all princess, an’ I is de eldest
son ob de eldest. King Blay fight him, an’ take
me prisoner, an’ sell me slabe, an’ dat is how I
come to work now ober here on Mistah Dupuy
plantation.’</p>

<p>After a pause, he asked quickly: ‘Who dis
sweetheart dat you want spell for?’</p>

<p>‘Isaac Pourtalès.’</p>

<p>‘Pourtalès! Him mulatto! What for pretty
naygur girl like you want to go an’ lub mulatto?
Mulatto bad man. Old-time folk say, mulatto
always hate him fader an’ despise him mudder.
Him fader de white man, an’ mulatto hate white;
him mudder de black girl, an’ mulatto despise
black.’</p>

<p>Rosina hung her head down slightly on one
side, and put the little finger of her left hand
with artless coyness into the corner of her mouth.
‘I doan’t know, sah,’ she said sheepishly after
a short pause; ‘but I feel somehow as if I lub
Isaac Pourtalès.’</p>

<p>Delgado grinned a sinister grin. ‘Very well,
Missy Rosy,’ he said shortly, ‘I gain him lub
for you. Wait here one, two, tree minute, le-ady,
while I run in find me Bible.’</p>

<p>In a few minutes, he came out again, dressed
in his black coat for meeting, with a Bible and
hymn-book in one hand, and a curious volume
in the other, written in strange, twisted, twirligig
characters, such as Rosina had never before in
her life set eyes on. ‘See here!’ he cried, opening
it wide before her; ‘dat is book ob spells. Dat
is African spell for gain lubber. I explain him
to you’&mdash;and his hand turned rapidly over several
of the brown and well-thumbed pages: ‘Isaac
Pourtalès, mulatto; Rosina Fleming, black le-ady;
dat is de page. Hear what de spell say.’ And
he ran his finger line by line along the strange
characters, as if translating them into his own
negro English as he went. ‘“Take toot’ ob alligator,”
same as dis one’&mdash;and he produced a
few alligators’ teeth from his capacious pocket;
‘“tie him up for a week in bag wid Savannah
flower an’ branch of calalue; soak him well in
shark’s blood”&mdash;I gib de blood to you&mdash;“den
write de name, Isaac Pourtalès, in big letter on
slip ob white paper; drop it in de bag; an’ burn
it all togedder on a Friday ebenin’, when it
doan’t no moon, wid fire ob manchineel wood.”
Dat will gain de lub ob your lubber, as sure as
de gospel.’</p>

<p>The girl listened carefully to the directions,
and made Delgado repeat them three times over
to her. When she had learned them thoroughly,
she said once more: ‘How much I got to pay
you for dis, eh, sah?’</p>

<p>‘Nuffin.’</p>

<p>‘Nuffin?’</p>

<p>‘No, nuffin. But you must do me favour.
You is house-serbant at Orange Grove; you must
come see me now an’ den, an’ tell me what go on
ober in de house dar.’</p>

<p>‘What far, sah?’</p>

<p>‘Doan’t you ax what far; but listen to me,
le-ady. De great an’ terrible day ob de Lard
will come before long, when de wicked will be
cut off from de face ob de eart’, an’ we shall
see de end ob de evil-doer. You read de
Prophets?’</p>

<p>‘I read dem some time.’</p>

<p>‘You read de Prophet Jeremiah, what him
say? Hear de tex’. I read him to you. “Deliber
up deir children to de famine, an’ pour out
deir blood by de sword.” Dat de Lard’s word
for all de Dupuys; an’ when de missy come
from England, de word ob de prophecy comin’
true.’</p>

<p>The girl shuddered, and opened wide her big
eyes with their great ring of white setting. ‘How
you know it de Dupuys?’ she asked, hesitating.
‘How you know it dem de prophet ’ludin’
to?’</p>

<p>‘How I know, Rosina Fleming? How I know
it? Because I can expound an’ interpret de
Scripture; for when de understandin’ ob de man
is enlightened, de mout’ speaketh forth wonderful
tings. Listen here; I tellin’ you de trut’.
Before de missy lib a year in Trinidad, de Lard
will sweep away de whole house ob de Dupuys
out ob de land for ebber an’ ebber.’</p>

<p>‘But not de missy!’ Rosina cried eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Ah, de missy! You tink when de black man
rise like tiger in him wrath, him spare de missy!
No, me fren’. Him doan’t gwine to spare her.
De Dupuys is great people now; puffed up wid
pride; look down on de black man. But dem
will drop dem bluster bime-by, as soon as deir
pride is taken out ob dem wid adversity.’</p>

<p>Rosina turned away with a look of terror.
‘You comin’ to prayer-meetin’?’ she asked hastily.
‘De bredderin will all be waitin’.’</p>

<p>Delgado, recalled once more to his alternative
character, pushed away the strange volume
through the door of his hut, took up his Bible
and hymn-book with the gravest solemnity, drew
himself up to his full height, and was soon walking
along soberly by Rosina’s side, as respectable
and decorous a native Methodist class-leader as
one could wish to see in the whole green island
of Trinidad.</p>

<p>Those who judge superficially of men and
minds, would say at once that Delgado was a
hypocrite. Those who know what religion really
means to inferior races&mdash;a strange but sincere
jumble of phrases, emotions, superstitions, and
melodies, permeating and consecrating all their
acts and all their passions, however evil, violent,
or licentious&mdash;will recognise at once that in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">{70}</span>
own mind Louis Delgado was not conscious to
himself in the faintest degree of any hypocrisy,
craft, or even inconsistency.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOME_AMERICANISMS">SOME AMERICANISMS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> erroneous impression generally exists in
this country as to the manner in which the
English language is spoken in the United
States. This has arisen in some degree from the
circumstance that travellers have dwelt upon
and exaggerated such peculiarities of language
as have come under their observation in various
parts of the Union; but also in greater measure
from the fact that in English novels and dramas
in which an American figures&mdash;no matter whether
the character depicted be represented as a man
of good social position and, presumably, fair education,
or not&mdash;he is made to express himself
in a dialect happily combining the peculiarities
of speech of every section of the country from
Maine to Texas. With the exception of the late
Mr Anthony Trollope’s <i>American Senator</i>, I cannot
recall to mind a single work of fiction in which
this is not the case. Take, for instance, those
portions of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> the scenes of which
are laid in the United States; Richard Fairfield,
in Bulwer’s <i>My Novel</i>; the Colonel in Lever’s
<i>One of Them</i>; Fullalove, in Charles Reade’s <i>Very
Hard Cash</i>; the younger Fenton in Yates’s <i>Black
Sheep</i>; or the American traveller in <i>Mugby Junction</i>&mdash;in
each and every instance the result is to
convey a most erroneous idea as to the manner in
which our common tongue is ordinarily spoken in
the United States.</p>

<p>It is the same on the stage. The dialect in
which Americans are usually made to express
themselves in English dramas is as incorrect and
absurd as was the language put into the mouths
of their Irish characters by the playwrights of
the early part of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the speech of educated
Americans differs but little from that of the same
class in Great Britain; whilst, as regards the
great bulk of the people of the United States,
there can be no question but that they speak
purer and more idiomatic English than do the
masses here. In every State of the Union the
language of the inhabitants can be understood
without the slightest difficulty. This is more
than can be said of the dialects of the peasantry
in various parts of England, these being in many
instances perfectly unintelligible to a stranger.
Again, the fluency of expression and command
of language possessed by Americans even in the
humbler ranks of life forms a marked contrast
to the poverty of speech of the same class in
this country, where, as an eminent philologist has
declared, a very considerable proportion of the
agricultural population habitually make use of a
vocabulary not exceeding three hundred words.</p>

<p>But to return to the subject of this paper.
Some words which have become obsolete in this
country, or now convey a totally different meaning
from that primarily attaching to them, are still
current in America in the sense in which they
were originally employed. <i>Prink</i>, to ornament
or adorn, which is found in Spenser and other
writers of the Elizabethan age, is at the present
day a common term in the Eastern States.
One Yankee girl will say to another, who has
been some time at her toilet, ‘Oh, you have been
prinking;’ or, ‘What a long while it has taken
you to prink.’ In fact the verb is used in all
its moods and tenses. <i>Muss</i>, a confused encounter
or scramble, is generally supposed to be a purely
American idiom. On the contrary, it is good
Shakspearean English. In <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>,
Antony says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">‘Of late when I cry’d ho!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Lamm</i>, to beat, to maltreat, is an American
word of English parentage. In a north-country
ballad of the time of Edward VI., one line runs,
‘They lammed him and bammed him;’ and the
word may also be found in Marlowe. <i>Sick</i> is an
expression universally used in the United States
in the sense of indisposition. A man will say,
‘I am sick,’ never, ‘I am ill.’ It scarcely need
be said that the phrase was perfectly good
English two centuries and a half ago, the word
‘ill,’ with the meaning now attaching to it, not
once occurring in the translation of the Bible.</p>

<p><i>Bug</i>, again, employed in America as a generic
term for every species of insect, was used in
England, formerly, in the same sense. ‘A bug
hath buzzed it in mine ears,’ says Bacon in
one of his letters. At the present day, the
word has in England so limited an application,
that when an edition of the works of Edgar
Allan Poe was published in London, the editor
altered the title of one story, <i>The Golden Bug</i>,
to <i>The Golden Beetle</i>, in order not to give offence
to ‘ears polite.’</p>

<p><i>Fearful</i>, which now signifies to inspire terror
or awe, has still in the United States the meaning
it bore in Shakspeare’s time, when it was invariably
used in the sense of timid or afraid. In
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, when Romeo, after slaying
Tybalt, is lying hidden in Friar Lawrence’s cell,
the Friar says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Romeo, come forth, come forth, thou fearful man;’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and again, in <i>The Tempest</i>, in that scene in
which Prospero threatens Ferdinand, Miranda
exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘O dear father,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make not too rash a trial of him, for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’s gentle and not fearful.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So obsolete, however, is now the word in the
sense in which it is employed by the poet,
that in most editions of Shakspeare, a footnote
is appended to it, giving the definition as
‘timorous.’ In America, the expression, ‘He is
a fearful man,’ or, ‘She is a fearful woman,’ is
frequently applied to an individual of timid
disposition, the meaning intended to be conveyed
being precisely the opposite to that which in this
country would attach to the phrase.</p>

<p>Some common English words have in the
United States completely lost their original signification,
wherefore, it would not be easy to say.
<i>Ugly</i>, for instance, means ill-natured; <i>smart</i>,
clever; <i>clever</i>, of an amiable disposition; and
<i>lovely</i>&mdash;although this last locution is not perhaps
so common as the others&mdash;lovable.</p>

<p>I was, when resident in New York, present
during a conversation in the course of which a
rather curious equivoque occurred, owing to the
peculiar sense in which the words in question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">{71}</span>
are used on the other side of the Atlantic. On
the occasion referred to, an American lady and
an Englishwoman&mdash;who had only been a short
time in the United States&mdash;were speaking of
an old gentleman with whom they both were
acquainted. The former was warm in his
praises.</p>

<p>‘Mr R&mdash;&mdash;,’ she declared, ‘is quite lovely.’</p>

<p>‘Why,’ was the surprised reply, ‘how can you
think so? I consider him decidedly ugly.’</p>

<p>‘Ugly!’ indignantly retorted the first speaker.
‘He is not at all ugly. On the contrary, he
is real clever.’</p>

<p>‘That Mr R&mdash;&mdash; is a man of talent, I admit,’
was the response; ‘but he is certainly anything
but good-looking.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I do not deny that he is homely, and
I never said that he was not,’ rejoined the other
lady.</p>

<p>‘But,’ exclaimed the puzzled Englishwoman,
‘you have just asserted that he was not ugly.’</p>

<p>‘No more he is!’ was the quick retort.</p>

<p>When the dialogue had reached this point, it
being obvious not only that the two ladies were
at cross-purposes, but that they were, in consequence,
becoming a little heated, I deemed it
advisable to interpose, and explain how their
mutual misapprehension had arisen.</p>

<p>In connection with the phrase, ‘A man of
talent,’ made use of by my countrywoman in
the course of the above conversation, I may
observe that ‘talent’ or ‘talented’ is an expression
seldom heard from the lips of a native of
New England. Lord Macaulay asserts that these
words owe their origin to the ‘Parable of the
Talents’ in the New Testament, and on one
occasion he challenged Lady Holland to cite a
single instance of their being employed by any
English writer prior to the latter part of the
seventeenth century. To the circumstance, therefore,
that at the period when the Puritans left
their native land to seek new homes in the
New World, the words in question had not been
incorporated into the language, may, I conceive,
be attributed the fact that to this day they
seldom have a place in the vocabulary of the
inhabitants of the Eastern States.</p>

<p>When a word is already in existence which
is fully adequate to express the idea it is employed
to convey, it seems not a little curious
that the use of it should be superseded by another,
not, indeed, coined for the purpose, but by one
divorced from its original meaning. Yet this
has been the case in various instances in the
United States. A place where goods are sold
at retail is called a ‘store,’ not a shop, the use
of the latter word being exclusively confined to
those establishments in which some manufacturing
or other mechanical industry is carried
on. When ‘corn’ is spoken of, maize or Indian
corn is always meant; all the other cereals
being invariably designated by their respective
names, as wheat, oats, barley, &amp;c. Railway in
America becomes ‘railroad;’ station, ‘depôt;’
line, ‘track;’ carriage, ‘car;’ whilst for tram,
the phrase employed is ‘horse-car.’ A timber
building is a ‘frame-building;’ a row of houses
is a ‘block’ of houses. For poorhouse or workhouse,
the expression used is ‘almshouse.’ When
the idea intended to be conveyed is that which
an Englishman attaches to the latter phrase,
the word ‘asylum’ or ‘home’ is used by an
American.</p>

<p>In fact, a list which should comprise all the
words employed by our transatlantic cousins in
a different sense from ourselves would be a tolerably
long one. But the desultory examples I
have given will suffice to illustrate the fact&mdash;to
which I have already adverted&mdash;that in numerous
instances, and without any apparent cause,
many common English words have acquired in
the United States a totally different meaning
from that which they bear in this country.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was nearly ten o’clock on the following morning
before Edgar reached the <i>Bedford</i>, Covent Garden.
He found the American in his private room
waiting his arrival, and clad in a loose dressing-gown,
which made him look extra tall and thin&mdash;a
wonderful garment, embracing every known hue
and colour, and strongly resembling, save as to
its garishness, a Canadian wood in the fall. Mr
Slimm laid aside a disreputable brier he was
smoking, as soon as he perceived his visitor.
‘Morning!’ he said briskly. ‘Tolerably punctual.
Hope you don’t object to the smell of tobacco so
early?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ Edgar replied, throwing himself
down in a chair. ‘Like most well-regulated
Britons, I cannot say I am partial to the smell of
tobacco before breakfast.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know,’ Mr Slimm responded dryly,
‘I have seen the time when I never smoked
before breakfast. I don’t allude to any great outbreak
of virtue on my part; but the fact is, when
a man can’t get a breakfast, he can’t be accused of
smoking before it&mdash;no, sir.’ Having administered
this crushing piece of logic with characteristic
force, Mr Slimm rang the bell and proceeded to
order ‘the fixings,’ which was his term for the
matutinal repast.</p>

<p>‘You Britishers have got some sound notions
on the subject of dinners and promiscuous refreshment;
but your imagination don’t soar to breakfast.
There’s nothing substantial about it,’ said
Mr Slimm, after finishing a pound or so of steak.
‘The Francatelli who rules the kitchen here is
fairly good; and I flatter myself if I stay here
much longer he will know what a breakfast is.
I stayed for a week at a little place off the Strand
once; but I was almost starved. Ham and eggs,
chops and steaks, was the programme, with a
sole, by way of a treat, on Sundays.’</p>

<p>‘Very sad,’ replied Edgar, with considerable
gravity. ‘You must have suffered. You don’t
seem, however, particularly short here.’</p>

<p>‘Well, no,’ Mr Slimm admitted, at the same
time helping himself to fish; ‘I can manage
here.’</p>

<p>‘I hope last night’s little scrimmage has not
injured your appetite this morning?’ Edgar asked
politely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">{72}</span></p>

<p>‘Not much. Æneas Slimm generally can pick
up his crumbs tolerably. This little village is
a fine place to sharpen the appetite.’</p>

<p>‘How long do you propose to stay here?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know; it all depends. I am doing
London, you see, and when I do a place, I do
it well. You’ve got some fine old landmarks
here&mdash;very fine,’ said Mr Slimm with proverbial
American reverence for the antique. ‘I guess
we should be proud of the Tower over to New
York&mdash;yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘I have never been over it,’ Edgar said carelessly.</p>

<p>‘Do, tell. Man, I guess you’re funning.
Seems to me kind o’ incredible for an Englishman
to live in London and not see the Tower.’</p>

<p>‘Really, Mr Slimm, I have never seen the
Tower.’</p>

<p>‘Wall, if this don’t beat snakes! Never seen
the Tower!’ exclaimed the American, chipping
his third egg. ‘Maybe you never heard of a
picturesque pile known to the inquiring stranger
as the British Museum?&mdash;Now, <i>have</i> you ever
heard of Westminster Abbey?’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Edgar laughingly, ‘I believe I
have; but I must confess that I have never been
inside either of the places you mention.’</p>

<p>‘Wonderful! Mr Seaton, you’re born to make
a name. The man who can pass these places
without emotion, ain’t no common shake. I
guess you’re the kind of matter they make genius
out of.’</p>

<p>‘You seem to be astonished. Surely, in New
York, you have buildings and churches quite as
fine as anything in London?’</p>

<p>‘You think so, do you? Wall, if it’s any
consolation to you, keep on thinking so; it won’t
hurt any one.&mdash;Mr Seaton,’ continued Slimm,
lowering his voice reverently, ‘when I get pottering
about down at Westminster, and look at the
Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, strike me
if I don’t wish I was a Britisher myself!’</p>

<p>‘That is high praise indeed; and I think it
is due to your native patriotism to say your
approval does you credit. But candidly, it
always struck me that our Houses of Parliament
are particularly mean-looking for their position.’</p>

<p>‘Maybe, maybe,’ Mr Slimm replied meditatively;
‘but there’s something about them that
makes me feel chockful of poetry. When I
wander into the Abbey among these silent stones
and listen to that grand organ, I feel it does me
good.’</p>

<p>‘You do not look like a man who took any
particular delight in music.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t, and that’s a fact. I don’t know F
sharp from a bull’s foot; but I can feel it. When
the artist presiding at the instrument pulls out
that wonderful stop like a human voice, I feel
real mean, and that’s a fact&mdash;yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘It is wonderful what an effect music has
on the human understanding,’ Edgar replied.
‘“Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast.”
My wife always says’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Your wife! I didn’t know you were married.’</p>

<p>‘Considering I never told you that interesting
fact, I do not see very well how you could
know,’ Edgar replied with a smile; which was,
however, not so cordially received by Mr
Slimm.</p>

<p>‘Um,’ he said doubtfully.&mdash;‘Now, look here,
my young friend; I’m a rough chap, and I’ve
just got to say my mind, if I die for it. Don’t
you think a young married man has no business
in such a place as we met last night?’</p>

<p>‘But, you see, I had business there,’ Edgar
said, still smiling. ‘It was stern business, and
nothing else, which took me to that place.’</p>

<p>‘You’ve got the bulge of me, and that’s a
fact.’</p>

<p>‘You mean, you don’t understand. Well, I
am what is usually known&mdash;or rather, in my
case, unknown&mdash;as a literary man. I am working
up a series of articles on gambling-houses.’</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you get on a more respectable
line?’</p>

<p>Edgar tapped his pocket and nodded significantly.</p>

<p>‘Hard up,’ said Mr Slimm. ‘Case of needs
must when what’s-his-name drives. You don’t
look as if you were dragged up to this sort of
thing neither?’</p>

<p>‘To be candid with you, I was not,’ Edgar
replied, urged by some strange impulse to confide
in the American. ‘I am a university man without
money. My history is a common one. Educated
at a public school, and afterwards at Cambridge,
I am expected to get a living in some
mysterious way. All my little money was spent
upon my education, and then I had to shift for
myself. Much good my second-class honours
have done me.’</p>

<p>‘Then, to prove your wisdom, you got
married?’</p>

<p>‘Of course. But now comes the most remarkable
part of my story. My wife was her uncle’s
heiress&mdash;not that her money was any inducement
to me&mdash;and I was engaged to her with his
approval. It was arranged I was to manage his
property, and we were to live with him. Then
a relative of his&mdash;a lady&mdash;came to stay, and
everything went wrong from that time. Finally,
acting under the lady’s wonderful fascination,
my wife’s uncle forbade our marriage, and
ordered her to marry a nephew of the lady’s.
This, of course, she refused to do, and was consequently
disinherited.’</p>

<p>‘What sort of a seraph was the lady?’ asked
Mr Slimm, with considerable interest.</p>

<p>‘Don’t mention her, pray. She had the evil-eye,
if ever woman had.&mdash;But to continue. After
our wedding, we came to London, and at different
times tried to bring about a reconciliation; but
to no effect. Then the old gentleman died.’</p>

<p>‘A common story enough; but considerable
rough on you and your wife,’ said Mr Slimm.</p>

<p>‘After that, a most remarkable occurrence
happened. When the will was proved, not a
sixpence of the old gentleman’s money could be
found&mdash;that is, excepting the few hundreds in
the local bank for household expenses. It is
four years ago now, and to this day not one
farthing has turned up.’</p>

<p>‘Penny plain, and twopence coloured,’ the
American said sententiously&mdash;‘to be continued
in our next. There’s the making of a sound
family romance about this.&mdash;Anything more?’</p>

<p>‘A little. An old companion of my wife’s
turned up the other day&mdash;or I should say my
wife found her accidentally in London. She
was standing in the rain on Waterloo Bridge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">{73}</span>
looking into the water.&mdash;You comprehend, don’t
you?’</p>

<p>‘“One more unfortunate, weary of breath,”’
quoted Mr Slimm with a tender inflection which
surprised Edgar. ‘Go on.’</p>

<p>‘It was a wonderful coincidence, if nothing
more. It appeared that my wife’s uncle on his
dying bed gave her a paper for my wife; and
he charged her most solemnly to find her and
deliver it, which has been done.’</p>

<p>‘And it was some secret cipher, bet my
boots.’</p>

<p>‘On the contrary, it is only a letter&mdash;a valedictory
letter, containing no clue whatever.’</p>

<p>‘Stranger, you take this matter sort of calm,’
said Slimm solemnly. ‘I should like to see that
letter. Mark me; providence has a hand in
this, and I want you not to forget it. Such a
meeting as that between your wife and her old
companion didn’t happen for nothing. Listen,
and I’ll tell you what once happened to me
in Australia. I shall never forget it. I’m a
rich man now, for my wants; but I was poor
then; in fact, it was just at the time when
fortune had turned. I had, at the time I am
speaking of, nearly a thousand ounces of dust
buried in my tent. As far as I could tell, not
a soul in the camp knew what I had, as I had
kept it quiet. Well, one night, I started out
to visit an old chum in a neighbouring claim.
It was nearly dark when I started, and I had
no companion but my dog. I had not gone
very far when he began to act in a ridiculous
manner, barking and snapping at my horse’s
heels, till I thought he was stark mad. Then
he turned towards home, stopping every now
and then to whine, and finally he struck off
home in a bee-line. I rode on, never thinking
anything about it till suddenly my horse
stumbled and nearly threw me. He had never
done such a thing before, and I hadn’t got
twenty yards before he did it again. Stranger!
I want you to believe I was scared, and I don’t
scare easy either. Then I thought of the tales
I had read about dogs and their cunning, and,
urged by something I can’t understand, I turned
back. You’d better believe I’m glad I did.
When I got back to my tent, I stole in quietly,
and there were three of the biggest scoundrels
in the camp digging away exactly over the gold.
I didn’t give them much time for meditation,
I reckon. It was a tough fight; but I saved
my gold. I got this valentine to remember it
by; darn their ugly pictures;’ and Mr Slimm
bared his huge chest, and displayed a livid gash
seamed and lined thereon.</p>

<p>‘And the robbers&mdash;what became of them?’</p>

<p>‘Suffocation,’ Slimm replied laconically. ‘The
quality of mercy is strained pretty considerable
in a mining camp.’</p>

<p>‘And the dog?’</p>

<p>‘Dead!&mdash;killed by these scoundrels. I ain’t
powerful in the water-cart line; but I don’t
mind saying I snivelled then. I can’t think of
that faithful insect without a kind of lumpiness
in my throat&mdash;And now, my friend, don’t you
tell me there’s no such thing as fate. You mind
if your affair don’t turn out trumps yet.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think so,’ Edgar replied dubiously.
‘It is all forgotten now, though it was a nine
days’ wonder in Somersetshire at the time.’</p>

<p>‘Somersetshire? Now, that’s strange. I’m
going to Somersetshire in a few days to see a
man I haven’t set eyes on for years. He is a
very different man from me&mdash;a quiet, scholarly
gentleman, a little older than myself. He is a
bookish sort of man; and I met him in the mines.
We kind of froze to each other; and when we
parted, it was understood that whenever I came
to England, I was to go and see him. What part
of Somersetshire do you hail from?’</p>

<p>‘The name of my wife’s old home is Eastwood.’</p>

<p>‘Eastwood? Tell me quickly, is it possible
that your wife’s uncle is Mr Charles Morton?’</p>

<p>‘The same,’ Edgar gasped.&mdash;‘What do you
know of him?’</p>

<p>‘What do I know of him? Why, he was
the man I was going to visit; and he’s dead,
poor old fellow! You see, I always liked him,
and once I saved his life. It’s a curious thing,
but when you do a man a favour, or save
his life, or any trifle of that kind, you always
get to like him some way. Poor old Morton!
Well, if this don’t beat snakes! And your wife
is the little Nelly he was always raving about?
Dear, dear!’</p>

<p>‘There must be something more than meets
the eye here,’ Edgar said, with a little quaver
in his voice. ‘Taking all the circumstances into
consideration, it looks as if some inscrutable
providence has a hand in it.’</p>

<p>‘You bet. I’m not particularly learned, nor
no scholar; but I do remember some lines of
your immortal poet which tells us “There’s a
divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them
how we will.” The more I think of life, the
more it puzzles me, and that’s a fact. To think
of you and I&mdash;two people in five millions&mdash;meeting
by such chance! And to think of your
wife being the niece of my old friend!’</p>

<p>‘Did he speak much of her to you?’ Edgar
asked.</p>

<p>‘A few. “Speak” is no word for it: he raved
about her. If ever a man loved a girl, it
was your uncle. You must not judge him
harshly.’</p>

<p>‘I do not; I never did. That there has been
collusion, or something more, I have always
been convinced. He was so fond of me till his
half-sister came; and as to Nelly, he worshipped
her.’</p>

<p>‘He just did, I know. I should like to see
that letter.’</p>

<p>‘So you shall; but really, I can see nothing
in it.’</p>

<p>‘Try and describe it to me.’</p>

<p>‘That is soon done. It is a commonplace
epistle, saying he wished to be remembered as
a friend, asking me to forgive him, and hinting
that if he had his life to live over again, how
different things would be.’</p>

<p>‘That is only a blind, perhaps.&mdash;Describe the
letter.’</p>

<p>‘It is written on part of a sheet of foolscap;
and from the beginning of the first line to the
finish, the paper is covered with writing.’</p>

<p>‘No heading or superscription, no signature?’
queried Mr Slimm.</p>

<p>‘No; it is not signed; but is precisely like a
letter without heading or signature trimmed close
up to the writing with a pair of scissors.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">{74}</span></p>

<p>‘And is it folded, or are there any lines
about it?’</p>

<p>‘It is folded like an ordinary note, and there
are various horizontal and perpendicular lines
upon it. The lines are dotted. Can you make
anything of it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said the American quietly. ‘I can
make fortune of it. Show me that letter for
five minutes, and I will show you something
you would give ten thousand pounds to see.’</p>

<p>And so, arranging for an early meeting, they
parted for the day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next morning, Eleanor told her husband of a
curious dream she had had during the night.
She thought she stood on a strange shore, with
the sea spread out before her to the utmost
horizon. It was sunrise, and coming towards
her over the quiet waters, was a great ship&mdash;an
‘Argosy with golden sails’&mdash;and somehow she
thought it brought golden treasure for her.
Three times she dreamed the dream, and saw
the stately ship. She asked Edgar what he
thought of it. He said that dreams went by
contraries.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LEGAL_ANECDOTES">LEGAL ANECDOTES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> writer remembers hearing of a gentleman
who, not wishing to pay the legal and recognised
fee for a consultation with his lawyer,
devised an expedient whereby he expected to
gain the information he required without the
usual cost. He accordingly invited the man
‘learned in the law’ to dine at his house on
a particular evening, as a friend and an old
acquaintance. The lawyer gladly accepted the
invitation, and attended at the house of his
friend and client prompt to the minute. The
conversation for some time was very general
and agreeable, and by-and-by the shrewd client,
by hinting and suggesting, at last drew the
lawyer out into a learned and explicit dissertation
upon the subject the host wished to be
informed upon. The client was pleased, satisfied,
and smiling, chuckled in his sleeve, thinking
how nicely he had wormed out the advice desired
and pumped his lawyer, free of cost!</p>

<p>The feast over, the lawyer departed, equally
pleased, and both being satisfied, all went as
merry as a marriage bell. But a few days afterwards,
the client received a letter from his lawyer
informing him that the charge for professional
consultation and advice was thirteen shillings
and fourpence, and would he ‘kindly attend to
the payment of same at his earliest convenience,
and oblige.’ The client was wild&mdash;caught in
his own trap. But being determined to outwit
the lawyer and gain his own ends, he forwarded
to the latter a bill for ‘dinner, wines, and
accessories supplied’ on the 16th inst., amounting
to thirteen shillings and fourpence, saying
that if he would settle the inclosed bill, he
should only be too pleased and happy to settle
the lawyer’s little bill. The lawyer retorted
by threatening to commence an action against
mine host for selling wines without a license,
unless his, the lawyer’s, bill was immediately
paid. Do I need to say that the lawyer was
victorious?</p>

<p>When I was a boy, I heard of a lawyer who
was called up in the middle of a cold winter’s
night to draw out the will of an old farmer
who lived some three miles away, and who was
dying. The messenger had brought a cart to
convey the lawyer to the farm; and the latter
in due time arrived at his destination. When
he entered the house, he was immediately ushered
into the sickroom, and he then requested to
be supplied with pen, ink, and paper. There
were none in the house! The lawyer had not
brought any himself, and what was he to do?
Any lead-pencil? he inquired. No; they had
none. The farmer was sinking fast, though quite
conscious. At last, the legal gentleman saw
chalked up on the back of the bedroom door
column upon column of figures in chalk. These
were milk ‘scores’ or ‘shots.’ He immediately
asked for a piece of chalk, and then, kneeling
on the floor, he wrote out concisely upon the
smooth hearthstone the last will and testament
of the dying man! The farmer subsequently died.
The hearthstone will was sent to the principal
registry in London with special affidavits, and
was duly proved, the will being deposited in
the archives of the registry. I may mention
that the law does not state upon what substance
or with what instrument a will must
be written.</p>

<p>It is stated that a lawyer was some time ago
cross-examining a witness in a local court, when
he asked: ‘Now, then, Patrick, listen to me.
Did the defendant in this case strike the plaintiff
with malice?’&mdash;‘No, sor, sure,’ replied Pat
gravely; ‘he struck him wid the poker, bedad.’
Again he inquired of the same witness: ‘Did
the plaintiff stand on the defensive during the
affray?’&mdash;‘Divil a diffinsive, yer honour; he
stood on the table.’</p>

<p>A celebrity noted for being ‘a bit of a poet’
was brought up before a bench of local magistrates
for an assault, when the following conversation
took place:</p>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> Is your name John Fray?</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> It is, your honour; so the people say.</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Was it you who struck this man and
caused the alarm?</p>

<p><i>Pris.</i> Sure it was, your honour; but I thought
there was no harm.</p>

<p><i>Mag.</i> Now, stop that! Did you come here
to make rhymes?</p>

<p><i>Pris.</i> No, your honour; but it will happen
sometimes.</p>

<p>The magistrate, laughing at the fellow’s ready
wit, said: ‘Go away, you rascal, get out of my
sight!’</p>

<p><i>Pris.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Thank ye, your honour; an’
a very good-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">{75}</span></p>

<p>There was once a plain out-spoken judge, who,
addressing the jury, said: ‘Gentlemen of the
jury, in this case the counsel on both sides
are unintelligible; the witnesses on both sides
are incredible; and the plaintiff and defendant
are both such bad characters, that to me it is
indifferent which way you give your verdict.’</p>

<p>It was once reported to the notorious Judge
Jeffries that the Prince of Orange was on the
point of entering into the country, and that
he was already preparing a manifesto as to his
inducements and objects in so doing. ‘Pray, my
Lord Chief Justice,’ said a gentleman present,
‘what do you think will be the heads of this
manifesto?’&mdash;‘Mine will be one,’ he grimly
replied.</p>

<p>An undoubted alibi was some time ago successfully
proved in an American court as follows:</p>

<p>‘And you say that you are innocent of the
charge of stealing this rooster from Mr Jones?’
queried the judge.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, I am innocent&mdash;as innocent as a
child.’</p>

<p>‘You are confident you did <i>not</i> steal the rooster
from Mr Jones?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir; and I can prove it.’</p>

<p>‘How can you prove it?’</p>

<p>‘I can prove that I didn’t steal Mr Jones’
rooster, judge, because I stole two hens from Mr
Graston same night, and Jones lives five miles
from Graston’s.’</p>

<p>‘The proof is conclusive,’ said the judge; ‘discharge
the prisoner.’</p>

<p>It is said that the other day a client received
the following bill from his lawyer: ‘Attending
and asking you how you did, 6s. 8d. Attending
you on the pier, when you desired me to look
through a piece of smoked glass, 6s. 8d. Looking
through the same, 6s. 8d. Rubbing my eye,
which watered, 13s. 4d. Attending at luncheon,
when you praised the sandwiches and asked me
to partake thereof, 6s. 8d. Consulting and asking
my opinion thereon, when I said they were very
good, 6s. 8d.’ Most probably the client treated
this as a joke; or perhaps it drove him to
extremities.</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen of the jury,’ said a counsel in a
suit about a herd of hogs, ‘there were just thirty-six
hogs in that drove; please to remember that
fact&mdash;thirty-six hogs; just exactly three times
as many as there are in that jury box, gentlemen.’
We are informed that that counsel did not win
his case. The jury were not so pig-headed.</p>

<p>Judge Kent, the well-known jurist, presided
in a case in which a man was indicted for burglary,
and the evidence at the trial showed that
the burglary consisted in cutting a hole through
a tent in which several persons were sleeping,
and then projecting his head and arm through
the hole and abstracting various articles of value.
It was claimed by his counsel that inasmuch as
he never entered into the tent with his whole
body, he had not committed the offence charged,
and must therefore be set at liberty. In reply
to this plea, the judge told the jury that if
they were not satisfied that the whole man was
involved in the crime, they might bring in a
verdict of guilty against so much of him as was
involved. The jury, after a brief consultation,
found the right arm, the right shoulder, and the
head of the prisoner guilty of the offence of
burglary. The judge accordingly sentenced the
right arm, the right shoulder, and the head to
imprisonment with hard labour in the State
prison for two years, remarking, that as to the
rest of the man’s body, he might do with it what
he pleased.</p>

<p>Lord Justice-clerk Braxfield was a man of
few words and of strong business habits, and
consequently when he courted his second wife,
he said to her: ‘Lizzie, I’m looking out for a
wife, and I thought you just the person to suit
me. Let me have your answer on or off
to-morrow, and nae mair aboot it.’ The lady,
next day, replied in the affirmative. Shortly
after the marriage, Lord Braxfield’s butler came
to him to give up his situation because he could
not bear her ladyship’s continual scolding. ‘Man,’
Braxfield exclaimed, ‘ye’ve little to complain of;
ye may be thankfu’ ye’re no’ married to her.’</p>

<p>During the time that Brougham was rising
in his profession, he had a friend, a brother-counsel,
who had contracted the habit of commencing
the examination of a witness in these
words: ‘Now, sir, I am about to put a question
to you, and I don’t care which way you answer
it.’ Brougham, with others, had begun to grow
tired of this eternal formula, and consequently
one morning he met his brother-lawyer near the
temple and addressed him thus: ‘Now, Jones,
I am about to put a question to you, and I don’t
care which way you answer it.&mdash;How do you
do?’</p>

<p>The celebrated lawyer Butt was one night
going home very late, when he was accosted
by a desperate-looking villain in one of the
suburbs of Dublin, and asked what he was going
‘to stand.’ ‘Well,’ replied Butt meekly, ‘I’m
very sorry that I can’t give you much, my friend,
but what I have we will share. Here,’ he continued,
drawing a revolver from his pocket, ‘is
a weapon which has six chambers; I will give
you three, and’&mdash;&mdash; But the lawyer immediately
found himself alone.</p>

<p>‘Mr Robinson,’ said counsel, ‘you say you
once officiated in a pulpit. Do you mean that
you preached?’&mdash;‘No, sir; I held the candle
for the man who did.’ ‘Ah, the court understood
you differently; they supposed that the
discourse came from you.’&mdash;‘No, sir; I only
throwed a light on it.’</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen of the jury,’ said an Irish barrister,
‘it will be for you to say whether this
defendant shall be allowed to come into court
with unblushing footsteps, with the cloak of
hypocrisy in his mouth, and draw three bullocks
out of my client’s pocket with impunity.’</p>

<p>We have heard of several cases of female
ingenuity in aiding the escape of prisoners.
Here is one. The criminals were handcuffed,
and with their escort were awaiting the train
which would convey them to the county jail.
Suddenly a woman rushed through the crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">{76}</span>
of spectators, and with a shower of tears, cried
out: ‘Kiss me; good-bye, Ned.’ The escort
good-naturedly allowed the process of osculation
to be performed, and the sheriff smiled feelingly.
The woman passed a key from her own to the
prisoner’s mouth, with which he undid the
‘bracelets,’ and escaped whilst the train was in
motion.</p>

<p>There is a girl who seems to have peculiar
notions of breach of promise cases, for she
threatens to sue her own father for breach of
promise! She explains that the old gentleman
first gave his consent to her marriage with her
lover, and then withdrew it, and that in consequence
her beau got tired of waiting, and has
gone off with another girl.</p>

<p>‘Prisoner at the bar,’ said the judge to a man
on his trial for murder, ‘is there anything you
wish to say before sentence is passed upon you?’&mdash;‘Judge,’
replied the prisoner, ‘there has been
altogether too much said already. I knew all
along somebody would get hurt, if these people
didn’t keep their mouths shut. It might as well
be me, perhaps, as anybody else. Drive on,
judge, and give me as little sentiment as you
can get along on. I can stand hanging, but I
hate gush.’</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> annexation of Upper Burmah to the British
Empire represents the most important addition
to our possessions which has been made for very
many years. Lying between India and China,
the two most populous countries in the world,
Burmah is favourably situated as a highway,
along which a vast trade can be conducted. As
to the country itself, it presents many valuable
features. It has a plentiful rainfall, a healthy
climate, and a luxuriant vegetation. The principal
crops are rice, oil-seed, cotton, and tobacco.
Sixty-one varieties of rice are known to cultivators,
and half of these are of the hard kind
familiar to us. The remainder have a soft glutinous
grain, which is preferred by the natives
of Burmah. The revenue and population of the
country have both increased enormously during
the past ten years.</p>

<p>In Mr Hallett’s interesting paper addressed to
the members of the Scottish Geographical Society,
entitled ‘A Survey for Railway Connections
between India, Siam, and China,’ he showed
that there is now no political hindrance to prevent
our driving the locomotive up to the gates
of China and opening up a vast trade with that
prosperous empire. Mr Hallett has personally
explored and surveyed Burmah, Siam, and the
Shan States, and he points out how a railway
can be made to join the Brahmapootra valley
with the valley of the Irrawadi, and that such a
railway could join the line which already finds
a terminus at the seaport of Rangoon. This
short line of railway, only one hundred and
sixty-two miles in length, pays a good dividend,
although it finds a formidable rival in the admirable
flotilla of steamers which ply on the Irrawadi
River hard by.</p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Russian Geographical
Society, M. Grjimaïlo gave an interesting
description of the Pamir region, which we may
remind our readers is a high tableland of Asia
on the western limit of Little Tibet. His tour
through this little-known region covered a period
of eighteen months, during which time he was
able to make extensive observations of its flora
and fauna, as well as of the condition of its
inhabitants. During the long winter, the people
have to seek the shelter of their tents, and seem
in the spring to wake up from a kind of lethargy
with the joy and light-heartedness of children.
The women do most of the work, which is of
a pastoral kind. The country is intersected with
enormous glaciers, and is situated at such a great
elevation that the natives call it by a name which
signifies ‘Roof of the World.’</p>

<p>The Cleopatra’s Needle which adorns Central
Park, New York, has suffered much from transatlantic
cold, and a mass of scales and chips
has been removed from it by atmospheric influences,
as thoroughly as if a number of masons
had been set to work to achieve the same result.
This gradual disintegration of the noble Egyptian
obelisk has, however, been stopped by coating
the monument with paraffin, which coating has
given a slightly darker colour to the stone.
Those who have charge of public buildings in
Britain which have been built of perishable
stone&mdash;and there are unfortunately many such&mdash;would
do well to make a note of this employment
of paraffin as a successful preservative.</p>

<p>A new artificial fireproof stone or plaster has
recently been invented. Its principal constituent
is asbestine, a mineral which is plentiful in certain
localities in the State of New York, U.S.A.
This asbestine, which is a silicate of magnesium,
is mixed with powdered flint and caustic potash,
and is then mingled with sufficient water-glass
(silicate of soda) to make it into an adhesive
plaster. In this condition it is prepared for
transport, and is mixed with sand before use.
This plaster is not only fireproof, but it adheres
with wonderful tenacity to perfectly smooth surfaces.
It does not, therefore, require a roughened
surface before attachment, such as a wall composed
of nailed laths, as is the usual case. A
common mode of applying it is to line a room
with sheet-iron, protected from rust by a coating
of asphaltum, and to spread upon this metal
basis a thickness of the new plaster. Besides
being unaffected by heat, it will not crack if
water is thrown upon it when in a heated
state.</p>

<p>Mr Hannay, of Glasgow, has invented a new
form of lamp which will prove very useful for
various industrial purposes, where the more intense
rays of the electric arc are not readily available.
The lamp consists of a cylindrical vessel
containing about thirty gallons of any heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">{77}</span>
hydrocarbon oil, such as creosote. At one side
of this vessel is an entry-pipe for air, which
must be under pressure of about fifteen pounds
on the square inch. The air thus admitted forces
the oil up a vertical pipe which springs from
the bottom of the vessel, and ends in a burner
which extends for some feet outside the oil
receptacle. Another pipe surrounds the oil-tube,
and through this, part of the air is carried, so
that at the point where both tubes terminate,
there rushes forth a blast of mingled air and
creosote in fine particles. This is turned into
a flame of great brightness when a match is
applied to it, a flame, too, which is unaffected by
wind or rain. The quantity of oil given above
will supply a light for about twenty hours, which
will be effective at two hundred yards from the
lamp. This contrivance has already been used
with success at the Forth Bridge works. It is
now being introduced for various purposes by
Mr James Sinclair, 64 Queen Victoria Street,
London.</p>

<p>A plan for rendering paper so tough that it
can be used for various purposes for which
formerly it was considered there was ‘nothing
like leather,’ has recently been published. The
process is of continental origin. The paper pulp
during manufacture is mixed with chloride of
zinc in solution, and the more concentrated this
solution is, the tougher is the finished paper.
It is said that the new material has been successfully
used in boxmaking, combmaking, and has
actually taken the place of leather in bootmaking.
This last application of the material
is perhaps not quite so much of a novelty as
it seems to be; for in the cheaper kinds of boots
and shoes, the soles, instead of being of solid
leather, are often made of a compound of which
brown-paper pulp seems to be the chief constituent.
The adulteration is not apparent to
the wearer until wet weather makes it very
evident indeed.</p>

<p>In the building operations of man he uses
hair to bind the particles of lime together in
forming a plaster wall. In the work of nature,
much the same end is achieved by binding loose
particles of soil together with the rootlets of
various plants. The continually slipping particles
of a newly made embankment have to be rendered
secure by this means; but such grasses
as have hitherto been used for the purpose
need several months for their development. M.
Cambier, of the French railway service, has
recently pointed out that the double poppy is
a valuable plant for this purpose. Its germination
is rapid, and in a week or two its rootlets
are sufficiently strong to give some support to
the soil. But at the end of three or four months,
the roots attain a length of twelve inches, and
form a far stronger network to hold the soil
in place than any grass known. The plant is
an annual, but it sows itself after the first
year.</p>

<p>We are glad to notice that a ‘Plumage League’
is being established for the purpose of discountenancing
the inhuman fashion now in vogue of
introducing the dead bodies of birds as ornaments
on ladies’ bonnets, hats, and dresses. Lady
Mount-Temple, in advocating the establishment
of this League, the members of which will bind
themselves to discourage in every way the use
of plumage in dress, writes thus: ‘A milliner
told me she had put twelve birds on one (dress).
Another told us of a ball-dress covered with
canaries.’ We should rejoice to see the Princess
of Wales or some other member of the Royal
Family setting her veto upon the cruel practice
of adorning female dress with the bodies of our
feathered songsters.</p>

<p>The Crematorium at Woking Cemetery has
just been used for the third time under the
auspices of the Cremation Society. In France,
the Prefecture of the Seine is about to spend
three thousand pounds on the erection of a
similar building in the well-known cemetery,
Père-la-Chaise. Sanitary reformers will rejoice
that cremation is making some progress in both
countries, although that progress is slow.</p>

<p>The fastest time ever made by a steam-vessel
has recently been made by the Falke torpedo boat,
built by Messrs Yarrow for the Austrian government.
The mean speed of her six runs over the
measured mile&mdash;during which time she was fully
fitted and in fighting trim&mdash;reached the wonderful
figure of 22.263 knots per hour. She then
ran, according to contract with the Austrian
government, for an hour at full speed, when she
covered just twenty-two and a quarter miles. It
is said that the vessel answered her helm well
throughout these trials, and that there was very
little vibration from the engines even when going
at the highest speed. Messrs Yarrow are building
twenty-four torpedo boats for the British government,
besides several others for foreign customers.</p>

<p>Every poison is supposed to have its antidote,
and the establishment of the torpedo system has
necessitated the introduction of an antidote in
the shape of torpedo catchers. The first vessel
of this type which has been constructed has
lately been tried at Portsmouth with satisfactory
results, not only with regard to speed, but also
with regard to manœuvring power. The vessel
was fitted with an inner and an outer rudder
on the system of Mr J. S. White, and known as
the ‘turn-about’ method. This vessel is built
of thin steel; it possesses a conning tower on
deck, from which it is steered, and it is one
hundred and fifty feet in length.</p>

<p>Some interesting gunnery experiments have
just been concluded at Portland Bill. Their
object was to test the value of the Moncrieff or
‘disappearing’ principle of mounting guns for
coast-defence, a system which, like most others,
has its detractors as well as its advocates. At
Portland, a dummy gun only was used, so that
the ship firing upon it from the sea had not
the disadvantage of attacking a foe who could
hit back. The gun was placed in a pit, and was
so arranged that it remained hidden for two and
a half minutes; then it appeared for half a minute,
delivered its imaginary fire&mdash;which was represented
by a puff of gunpowder to aid the foe in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">{78}</span>
sighting it&mdash;and again disappeared. The ship
<i>Hercules</i> failed to make any impression upon the
gun at all, although it was only made of wood and
canvas. We may therefore conclude that the
Moncrieff or ‘disappearing’ system of mounting
guns is the most effectual which has ever been
brought forward, and we may look for its great
extension in our coast-defences.</p>

<p>Professor Germain Sée, of Paris, during a course
of lectures on dietetics, has recently pointed out
the importance of water in connection with food,
that fluid being the only one which can dissolve
the salts taken with the food into the
body, and eliminate them from the system.
He also remarked that it was quite impossible
for man, an omnivorous being, to exist entirely
on vegetable foods. So-called vegetarians are
forced to make up for the want of solid meat
by consuming eggs, milk, and butter. A healthy
man must for his food draw upon the elements
furnished by the three kingdoms of nature.</p>

<p>A new kind of turning-lathe, which seems really
to possess the merit of novelty, is described
by the <i>Scientific American</i>. It is intended for
turning such articles as balusters for staircases,
when such articles are required in quantities,
and when they are wanted to be square or
octagonal, instead of round. The lathe consists
of a kind of skeleton cylinder, upon the surface
of which the square rods which are ultimately
to form balusters are readily clamped by levers
working at each end. An ordinary T-rest
supports the tool in cutting the required ornamentation
on the rods as the lathe revolves.
When one side of the rods has thus been treated,
they are unclamped, turned over, and once more
fixed in place. In this way the four sides of
the square rods are operated upon one after the
other. This lathe, which has been patented,
will finish with clean, sharp edges about fifty
balusters or other pieces of wood an hour.</p>

<p>The <i>Lancet</i> alludes to an alleged discovery
which has been made in Columbia, which, if
it should be confirmed, will be a valuable aid
in surgery. It is reported that a certain shrub
which is called ‘aliza’ exudes a juice which
has the property of stopping hemorrhage, so
that if a surgeon’s operating knife were only
smeared with this juice, his work could be done
with little or no loss of blood.</p>

<p>A meteorological station twenty thousand feet
above the sea-level is being established by the
Mexican government among their highest mountains.
Those who remember the hardships which
were encountered by Mr Wragge in his constant
visits to the instruments on Ben Nevis before
the observatory building was established there,
will be prepared to understand the difficulties of
dealing with a station at so much higher an
altitude. For this reason, the instruments are
being constructed to work automatically, to be
self-recording, and, as far as possible, to require
no attention for twelve months, if need be.</p>

<p>The Chinese alphabet consists in its integrity
of about forty thousand pictorial symbols, and
it is this alphabet which with some modifications
has been used from time immemorial by their
clever and more advanced neighbours in Japan.
But the adoption of Western ways which has
since 1868 been so rapid among the Japanese,
has made them discontented with a system so
elaborate and bewildering. They have therefore
formed a Society called the Roman Alphabet
Association, by which they seek to replace the
cumbrous Chinese alphabet by the twenty-two
letters of the Roman alphabet which are found
sufficient to express all the sounds found in the
Japanese language. The change is a necessary
one, and marks a new and important phase of
Japanese progress. It is somewhat akin to the
movement which has for some time been in
progress in Germany, by which Roman characters
are being substituted for the old Gothic ones.</p>

<p>At a late meeting of the Royal Astronomical
Society, it was announced that M. M. Henry had
photographed part of the Milky-way. The
exposure required was an hour, but the star
discs were perfectly round and sharp. This
wonderful result shows that the driving clock
for keeping the telescope in motion, so as to
counteract the motion of the earth, must have
been of the most perfect kind.</p>

<p>From Germany, we learn that in that country
during the last ten years the leather manufacture
has shown a most extraordinary development.
Large factories have been established, which produce
goods of the highest quality, and compare
favourably with those of foreign make. No
expenses have been spared to import the best
machines; the sons of the most prominent manufacturers
are sent to America, England, and
France, to learn the manufacture of the leather
trade in all its details. The largest firms study
principally the American methods of manufacturing,
and the consequence is that many German
factories are managed after the American system.
German manufacturers are anxious to raise their
goods to the highest perfection, and look forward
to the time when German machine-made
ladies’ boots will be found in the West End of
London.</p>

<p>We learn from a South African newspaper that
Natal is at last going to cultivate tea in earnest.
The aroma of the samples produced is described
as excellent; it has a taste by no means unpleasant,
which is not characteristic of China teas,
but it is one which would be readily acquired
and appreciated. It is anticipated that fifty
thousand pounds will be grown this season.</p>

<p>A large German lithographic firm doing a considerable
trade in England, it is said has entirely
left off printing from stone, and uses zinc plates
only. The saving is said to be very considerable,
and may partly explain how they are able to
print more cheaply than our own lithographers.
A Chicago trade journal estimates that if a work
is to be printed in ten colours, requiring five
double-sized stones of twenty-eight by forty-two
inches, the cost of each stone would be about
twelve pounds, while a first-class zinc plate costs
eight shillings.</p>

<p>Mr H. T. Crewe, 17 Sunning Hill Road, Lewisham,
London, S.E., has recently patented a system
by which conservatories, the various structures
of the horticulturist, and other buildings, can be
fitted with glass roofs and walls without the use
of putty. The system is an extremely simple one.
Panes of glass are laid upon parallel rafters or
beams. They are not placed flatly one beside
the other, but the upper panes are made to
slightly overlap the lower panes. They are fixed
together by means of little metal clips, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">{79}</span>
receive screws, that afterwards pass through holes
in the panes and into the rafters or beams.
Among the advantages claimed for the new
system of glazing are, that it causes the roof to
remain perfectly rain-proof, and that the greatest
facility and despatch are attained in detaching
and replacing panes. Condensation is carried
away from the inside of the glass by the grooves
which are cut in the rafters or beams.</p>

<h3>SAFETY IN RAILWAY TRAVELLING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Edward Harford</span>, general secretary to the
Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, replying
to a request forwarded by peers, members of
the House of Commons, and others for information
as to the causes of railway accidents, and
the means which, in the opinion of the Society,
ought to be adopted for the safety of the general
public and of railway servants, has issued a list
of twenty-three proposals which set forth the
necessary requirements. The principal are the
following:</p>

<p>‘All railways ought to be worked on the
absolute block-system, strictly carried out, so that
no two trains shall ever be in one section at the
same time.</p>

<p>The blocks and interlocking systems should be
electrically combined and controlled, so that the
safety of a block-section shall be under the control
of two signalmen.</p>

<p>Junction block-working should be adopted at
all junctions, so that no two trains which can
foul each other at the points and crossings shall
ever be allowed to approach a junction at one
and the same time. All sidings and goods-lines
should be provided with properly interlocked
safety-points.</p>

<p>One code of block-system regulations and one
pattern of signals should be adopted throughout
the kingdom. A red light should be the only
danger-signal. The practice of using purple or
other lights is highly dangerous.</p>

<p>Facing-points ought to be avoided as far as
possible. All facing-points, and points leading
to main-lines, ought to be provided with a locking-bar
and bolts, and properly interlocked with
the signals and with the electric apparatus.</p>

<p>All passenger-trains ought to be provided with
an efficient automatic continuous brake, having
brake-blocks upon the wheels of the engine,
tender, and every vehicle throughout the train,
and fulfilling the five conditions laid down by
the Board of Trade, August 30, 1877, and highly
approved by the Society. To avoid the present
dangerous practice of brake-power being cut off
and rendered useless by the introduction of an
unfitted vehicle, it ought to be the law that the
Company should not be allowed to send vehicles
over the line of another Company unless each
vehicle is provided with the same form of continuous
brake as that used by such foreign Company.</p>

<p>All goods-engines should be fitted with brakes
upon their wheels, and those required occasionally
for passenger-traffic should have continuous
brakes.</p>

<p>All passenger-trains should be fitted with efficient
means of communication with the driver
and guards. Passengers should be able to reach
it without putting their hands outside the window.
The present cord-system is unreliable, and the
plan of having no communication on trains which
stop every twenty miles is very risky to the
public.</p>

<p>All passenger-platforms should be raised to the
standard height, and all carriages fitted with a
high continuous footboard, to prevent persons
falling between platforms and trains.</p>

<p>The crank or driving-axles of locomotive
engines should be taken out after they have run
a certain mileage. What the mileage limit should
be ought to be at once decided by the Companies
and the Board of Trade.</p>

<p>Overwork on railways is highly dangerous, and
ought to be abolished.’</p>


<h3>HOW CHILDREN GROW.</h3>

<p>During the International Medical Conference
held in Copenhagen in the summer of 1884, a
paper read by the Rev. Mailing Hansen, Principal
of the Danish Institution for the Deaf and Dumb,
was listened to with marked attention and interest.
It gave the results of the daily weighing
and measurements of height which he had carried
on for nearly three years on the one hundred and
thirty pupils&mdash;seventy-two boys and fifty-eight
girls&mdash;of the Institution, and demonstrated facts
as to the development of the human body during
the period of childhood that perfectly startled
and astonished the assembled medical authorities,
opening an entirely new field for investigation
and reflection. Since then, Mr Hansen has continued
his observations; and though he has yet a
tremendous amount of work before him, he
believes himself able to state now the outlines of
the results he has obtained.</p>

<p>The children are weighed four times daily in
batches of twenty&mdash;in the morning, before dinner,
after dinner, and at bedtime, and each child is
measured once a day. The common impression
is, no doubt, that increase in bulk and height
of the human body during the years of growth
progresses evenly all through the year. This is
not so. Three distinct periods are marked out,
and within them some thirty lesser waverings
have been observed. As for bulk, the maximum
period extends from August until December;
the period of equipoise lasts from December
until about the middle of April; and then
follows the minimum period until August. The
lasting increase of bulk or weight is all accumulated
during the first stage; the period of equipoise
adds to the body about a fourth of that
increase, but this gain is almost entirely spent
or lost again in the last period.</p>

<p>The increase in height of the children shows
the same division into periods, only in a different
order. The maximum period of growth
in height corresponds to the minimum period
of increase in bulk, and <i>vice versâ</i>. In September
and October a child grows only a fifth of what
it did in June and July. In other words,
during a part of the year&mdash;autumn and beginning
of winter&mdash;the child accumulates bulk, but the
height is stationary. In the early summer the
bulk remains nearly unchanged, but the vital
force and the nourishment are expended to the
benefit of height. While the body works for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">{80}</span>
bulk there is rest for the growth, and when the
period of growth comes, the working for bulk
is suspended. The human body has, consequently,
the same distinctly marked periods of development
as plants.</p>


<h3>A CHESS-CLOCK.</h3>

<p>An ingenious clock has recently been patented
by Messrs Frisch and Schierwater, 29 Church
Street, Liverpool. It not only shows the ordinary
time, but registers on separate dials&mdash;marked
respectively ‘black’ and ‘white’&mdash;the period occupied
by the players in a game of chess. It also
indicates the number of moves in a game and
whose turn it is to play. Another feature is the
index upon the dial. This can be set for any
time agreed upon&mdash;from one to fifteen minutes&mdash;during
which a move must be made. The expiration
of that time is shown by an indicator and
by the ringing of a bell. By pressing a knob at
the top of the clock, it is possible to temporarily
check the progress of the mechanism. This would
of course become necessary upon the players
requiring a rest, or upon any other interruption
taking place. The invention is, we believe, the
first clock that has been constructed with a view
to recording the movements in chess-playing. It
may of course be utilised for other purposes.
Being a travelling clock, it may be employed for
indicating the times of different countries. The
index and call-bell may be used, too, for public
meetings, allowing so much time for each speaker;
for a telephone Company, regulating an allowance
of time; or for the testing of any machinery.
The movement can be fitted to any existing clock.
As a result of practical trial, the ‘Schierwater’s’
Patent Chess-Clock has been commended by many
well-known chess-players.</p>


<h3>NOVEL PHOTOGRAPHIC EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p>The sinking of the caissons of the Forth Bridge
has afforded opportunity for testing whether it
was possible to obtain photographs below water
in compressed air by the aid of electric light.
To the novel conditions under which these
attempts&mdash;the first, we believe, in this country&mdash;were
made, their chief interest is due, rather
than to any particular success hitherto achieved.
We have recently described the method of
founding by compressed air, and depicted the
interior of a caisson, so that our readers are
conversant with the surroundings under which
the attempts were made.</p>

<p>A trial was made on shore by electric light at
night to determine the length of exposure necessary
for the plates; but subsequent experience proved
the data thus obtained to be of little value in
the air-chamber. Various trials were then made
in the air-chamber with different classes of plates
and gradually increasing lighting-power; eventually,
five arc-lamps&mdash;each equivalent to twelve
hundred candles&mdash;and plates of exceptional
rapidity, were employed; and these, with an
exposure of two minutes, gave the best results
obtained.</p>

<p>The roof and sides of the air-chamber were
whitewashed, to render them conspicuous and to
diffuse the light. The formation of moisture on
the lens threatened at first to give trouble; but
after a little time the glass became warmed, and
the difficulty ceased. The haze in the air-chamber,
which any sudden expansion of the
air&mdash;such as that due to its escape when the
air-locks were opened&mdash;greatly intensified, proved
a formidable obstacle, and must always render
the highest results unattainable. The only course
was to seize the most favourable moment when
the haze was at its minimum. White objects
and light clothing gave the best results; whilst
the eyes of a group&mdash;presumably from their
glistening properties&mdash;are remarkable for definition
and sharpness.</p>

<p>So far as could be ascertained, no injury
resulted to the dry plates either from air-pressure
or moisture.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
